# Bad Frame Rate UI

This project has too much assets in its scene which causes performance issues and bad framerate.
It also have a UI which is affected by the performance issue.

The goal of the game is to fixe the performance issue of the UI.
UI should be fluid.
There is one rule: the main 3D scene (everything except canvas) cannot be fixed.

The project was created with Unity 2018, but this is not a constraint and any solution involving upgrading to a recent Unity version would still be appreciated.
